⚡ Fun fact: 
            The Computer that took Mankind 🚀👨‍🚀 to the moon 🌑🌒🌓 was the Apolo Guidance Computer. 
            The Apollo Guidance Computer (AGC) had the following specifications:
                              1. Word length: 15 bits with an added bit for parity checks.
                              2. Memory: 36K of RAM and 2K of ROM.
                              3. Processing speed: Ranged from 50,000 to 100,000 instructions per second.
                              4. Clock speed: 1.024 MHz.
                              5. Unique storage technology: Used rope memory.

You are probably viewing this on a PC, Smartphone or Smart device that is 100,000 times more powerful than the computer that took humans to the moon! 🤯🤯🤯
